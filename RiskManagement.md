**Impact Scale** <br>
Impact is on a scale from 1 to 5 denoting the severity of the impact on the project. <br>
1 - Low <br>
2 - Medium-low <br>
3 - Medium <br>
4 - Medium-high <br>
5 - High <br>


**Probability Scale:**<br>
Probability of a risk occuring on a scale from 1 to 5. <br>
1 - Very unlikely <br>
2 - Unlikely <br>
3 - Netural <br>
4 - Likely <br>
5 - Very likely <br>


**Total Risk Scale:**<br>
Total risk = impact * probability. <br>
1-5 - low <br>
6-10 - Medium-low <br>
11-15 - Medium <br>
16-20 - Medium-high <br>
21-25 - High <br><br>



|Possible Risk: | Impact: | Effect on Project: | Reduction Strategy: | Probability: | Total Risk: |
|:--------------|:--------|:-------------------|:--------------------|:-------------|-------------|
|Requirement inflation | 4| Sponsors keep asking for more things, making the time frame for the project undoable. | Stick to the core requerments first, and if time permits, implement stretch goals.  If the requirements of the project keep building up after the requirements document has been signed off on,  negotiate with the customer to try and draw them back to a more realistic goal.  If worst comes to worst, contact the upper management (Bart).| 3| 12|
|Under estimation of time necessary to complete certain tasks |3 | A part of the project could end up taking more time than anticipated, affecting the entire time line of the project.| Get early feed back from members and allow for re-estimating of time needed for specific tastes. |4 | 12 |
|Data loss | 5| This could have a low to very high effect on the project depending on data lost.| Multiple backups.| 2| 10 |
|Poor time management | 5| Project could end up in an incomplete or cut down form.| Daily check-ins,  good planning/scheduling practices.|2 | 10|
|Misinterpreting client specifications/requirements | 3| Spending time redoing different parts of the project. Worse case scenario, the client is unhappy with the delivered project. | Maintain clear communication, multiple versions/iterations of project. | 3| 9 | 
|Loss of teammate(s) | 3| Medium effect on the project, others should be able to step in to the empty role. | Daily check-ins for early detection.| 2| 6| 
|Poor implementation (buggy) | 3| This may lead to the sponsor being unable to use the software. It also could affect time management trying to fix the problems.|Test to catch and fix bugs early in the iterative process, and be flexible to fix problems that arise for the next iteration of the program. | 2| 6 |
|Incomplete/unclear specifications | 3| This can lead to poor implementation and the client not receiving the project they asked for.| Work with the client throughout the design process, so that if the original specification is insufficient they can elaborate at a later time. | 2| 6 |
