RCS
    - Sensor
        I2C <- "I sqared c" very popular, can research this
        gryo
    - Control
        GPIO
        solinoids

Build & TEST:
    feed it simulated data (Controll & Sensor)
    Test harness in between RCS and Control & Sensor
    Possibly: output either live or fake Control based on testing input data

Feed in real or fake at COMPILE time but not runtime
    Avoid going into test mode at runtime (during a flight)

Will be privided a simulator
    JSBSim
    we will have to parse JSBSim documentaiton as well
    JSBSim was highly rated by NASA
    -> Assign someboy task of learning how to talk to JSBSim using Rust

Stretch goals:
    more sensors
    arbitrary data bus
    controllers may not be GPIO
    doing: Rust version of Python, buuuut, also want more sensor data and Control data

Telemetry:
    802.11 going to the ground
    no reason to send to JSBSim
    information to the ground does not effect program
    possibly capture incoming data (stretch goal)

POC:
    how to link RCS to JSBSim
    will have to convert JSBSim -> MPU9150, etc.

Boards
    board: mpu9150 <- available right now
    Board: mpu6050, 9 degree of freedom IMU <- using for RCS






Get JSBSim from sourceforge
    Will get help on simple model to use
