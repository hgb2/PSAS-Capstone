General project strategy: 10 minutes
    -> Next 5 week plan
        . Planning and organizing
            - Risk management - Grid of risks/likelyhoods, with mitigations
            - Project Schedule - Calendar tracked events, high level drilling down to details (weekly is best)
        . Aditional documents
            - Solid initial design considerations before we start coding
                - Shooting for 10 weeks of coding after this 5 weeks
                - Need something to fit in that timeline

Role discussion and assignment: 5-10 minutes
    -> Roles are:
        . Sponsor liason / Backup lead || cort
        . Requirements and Specification Documentor || Paul
        . Risk management Documentor || Tyler
        . Project schedule Documentor || Chris
        . Communication Documentor, address, phone, preferred email, backup phone if possible, backup eamil, confirming communication channels || sohail
        . IT/DevOps (git, backups, hosting, communication, task tracker, build tools (cargo?) ) || Harrison

    -> Other possible roles for the future to consider
        . Front end or back end lead?
        . QA lead/team?

Strategy and Tools: 5-15 minutes (Most of this is not set in stone, and discussion needs to happen around it)
    -> ALL documents will be in source control unless a very good reason is given they should not be
        . Means all documentation should be in text files, readable on a linux machine using terminal readers
            - You CAN have them "compile" or "render" for better output
                . Options are:
                    - Plain text
                    - Markdown (github?)
                    - LaTeX (maybe, might use this format for final outputs if we have time)
                    - PDF (though it's not change controlled, static files are fine)
                        . PDF's that are generated should not be included
    -> NOT included in source control
        . Anything that is compiled or generated using the source material in source control already
        . IDE files, sublime text files, etc.
        . Possibly more
    -> Communication
        . Email
        . Chat options:
            - Slack
            - IRC
            - Other?
        . Google hangouts (for remote meetings)
        . Google docs (Try to keep this at minimum as possible)
    -> Source hosting
        . Github? (need sponsor input)
    -> Task tracker
        . Options:
            - github (or other source hosting) issue tracker
            - Trello (simple kanban style board)
            - Text files? (live in source control?)
    -> Daily update
        . Using a communication method, send in daily (yes, daily) updates of progress
            - Includes "I did nothing today"
            - Justification
                . Keeps me informed
                . Creates history we can all use


information from sponsors

Assignments:
    Research your documents
    Start writing things
    Get IT set up
    Slack is up -> Ask questions
    Daily updates start as soon as slack is up


Take sensor data in, crunch, send commands
Highly testable
cross platform testing (kinda, linux based anyway)
simulated vs real sensors

Specific application: Reaciton control system (RCS) - cold gas jets
    software control valves
    8 nossels, 6 degrees of freedom
    4 for x/y
    4 for rotation
    
current POC in python
    we get source
    on github
    Don't need control theory
    P-controller???

Monday 05/09
====================
Announcements: <1 minutes
    -> Slack is up: Everyone is on
    -> Trello is up: Everyon is on
    -> Github is up: https://github.com/hgb2/PSAS-Capstone, clone it an put our documents in there!
        . Is everyone a contributor?

Updates: 15 minutes
    -> Cort
        . Architecture
    -> Paul
        . Requirements & specification
            - Does the iteration plan document look useful?
    -> Tyler
        . Risk Management
    -> Chris
        . Project Schedule
            - Talk about using excel sheet
    -> Sohail
        . Communication document
            - Put on slack and not on github so we don't spam personal information
        . + Work breakdown structure
    -> Harrison
        . Devops Update
        . + make sure everyone is contributor
        . 

Timeline: <5 minutes
    -> Check out Chris' document
        . When our initial documentation needs to be done by
        . How far are we in gathering these documents? (live updates)

Git etiquette: 5 minutes
    -> Keep a separate branch for documentation updates
        . View on GitHub branches, then push to master when
    -> We will not be using git rebase
        . Use a merge with merge conflicts strategy
    -> Master will be the primary branch, we don't need secondary or development branches
    -> Branching should be:
        . Feature based
        . Bug fixing based
        . Short description oriented, we should know what a branch is for and why it exists

Git workflow: 10 minutes
    -> Workflow if pair programming or group programming (maybe we will try mob programming)
        . Starting with no branches except for master
        . git checkout -b <descriptive_name> // This will create and checkout the branch
        . Do work on that branch (commit ... commit ...)
        . git push <branch_name> -> origin <branch_name>
        . git checkout master
        . git pull
        . git merge <branch_name>
            - Possible: manage merge conflics (edit documents)
            - Once done, git pull again! (just in case others pushed in the meantime)
        . git push master -> origin master
    -> workflow if programming on ones own
        . Follow the pair programming guide up until mergeing with master locally
        . Instead of mergin with master, do a git diff master..<branch_name>
            - This produces a line diff on the two branches, highlighting changes
        . Submit that for code review in Slack channel
            - Code review in slack should hang around for no longer than 24 hours if we can help it
        . If accepted for code review: re-pull master, merge with master, then push master
        . If not accpted, rewrite and submit for code review (likely directly to the same person) until accepted
